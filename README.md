    <h1>About Daria</h1>
    <h2>That lost girl</h2>
    There is more to Daria than the mistake that happened on the first day of
    school. For example, she knows how to draw!
    <br />
    Daria thought she knew something about JS from Khan acadamy lessons, but
    after starting her first project she realized
    <br />
    she is just like a monkey trying to swim in the middle of the ocean. But, a theory states that
    monkeys evolved into humans eventually, so
    <br />
    technically she should adapt the the cold and murky waters of javascript...
    or drown, but thats unlikely!
    <br />
